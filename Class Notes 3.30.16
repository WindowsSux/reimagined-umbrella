Need to solidify modules (again)
Discuss how to snapshot webapp and queries

Critical path:
  There is a task path that takes the longest non-redundant time (this is the critical path)
  The length of the critical path defines the minimum length of time to complete the project
    (The manual can be done at any time and debugging takes 6 weeks - so delaying the manual by a day is ok but the debugging should not be delayed)
    Do not let the critical path slip!
  Make sure there are plans in place to be able to fix schedule slippage along the critical path.
    (The solution to this isn't more man hours - adding more manpower to a late project makes it later)
      Solutions: delay the release, work smarter not harder (find a way to fix it), scale down
    
  What does the critical path look like and what are the contingency plans?
    
Next client meeting is April 4, last meeting (hopefully) is April 18.  However we have until May 2.
