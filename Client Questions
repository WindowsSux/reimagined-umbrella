Start listing any question you think of... we will refine later:

  What is the purpose of the app?
    What is the product of using the app?
    What is the input?
  For whom is the app intended?

Mike's Q's:
What do you imagine a user seeing while they use this app?
What do you imagine the administrator will see from the app? (i.e. after user is done, while user is on, etc.)
What is the function of the app?
Will the app be running on a specific device, or multiples types of devices?
What programs are similar to what you're imagining?
