  Has Access app on tablet
  Juola meta-question: Are the screens configurable for adding new database information?
    Can you add an "add add new section" button on the homescreen?
  Clara's comments Access option:
    flexibility concern
    class list changes in the middle of the year
    teachers could be teaching multiple classes
    likes simple homepage - good homepage interface -- especially the simple buttons
    likes check boxes for class days
      could she change these in the middle of the year?
      (sarah's interjection thought - could we do drop down menus for the class start and end time? 
        hour, minute (maybe in 5 or 10 minute increments), am/pm)
    how does this deal with holidays and days off?
      class cancelling more concerned with projections
    is there a way to have a drop down menu for employee names in the timecard?
    is there a way to have active/inactive employees
  Clara's comments WebApp option:
    likes the format of the webapp
    need to look into importing
      (mark's interjection: need a standard format for an excel document for uploading)
    would this have a calendar and be able to predit and project the dates?
    would like day of the week checkboxes
    date range is a semester or whole year (doesn't matter) as long as the holiday part is included
      time part is not necessary for the dates but needs class start and end time
    likes that everybody can have access but not edit
    doesn't have to be on a certain computer to run a report
    
  Clara's comments on reporting:
    Line item breakdown useful
    Change "pace" to "planned" in line item reporting
    readonly views are helpful

  How will Clara be able to edit the app when she's on her own?
  
  She likes the webapp features to share best.  Bad experience with access in a dropbox and locking people out from a shared file.
  Need flexibility from year to year with an import feature
    Clayton interject - add button on datasheet
    make sure we copy information before we edit
  Enter timesheets individually by person
  Classes within a semester have unique names and only repeat the following year if there are the same classes
  teachers keep the same salary for each class but may get a new contract for a new position with a different salary
    (teacher might get a case manager or secretary contract mid-year)
  Teachers who sub might get a different salary from the regular teacher
    (ie a class could have multiple teachers and multiple salaries)
  Clerical, supplies, travel under grant - extra classes tied to classes
    Travel should be attached to a person under a grant
  Teachers under classes under grant
  Nice to have: Purchase Order number/comment field
  Grant entry: broken down into subsection: supplies (general and books), travel, teachers, (other???)
    add line item for grant feature
  
  reports:
    where are the teachers salareies being charged to?
      report for teacher
      report for all teachers for each grant
      clara understands hours better - others understand dollars better
  
  Juola:
    how does information get out of the tablet
    is there any way to get data in in bulk?
      rollover function?
      import function?
      helpful for importing classes and teachers more quickly
    could classes have multiple locations?
      might not have the same holidays
        some places might have off for election day, others not
    could build in the option for a frequency
      could we handle a biweekly option?
        clara says there is one class that meets only the first two weeks of the month
        workshops sometimes happen once a month
        
Holiday calendar:
  building specific or all classes option
