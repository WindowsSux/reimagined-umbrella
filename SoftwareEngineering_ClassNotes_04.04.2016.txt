04/04/2016

------------------------------------------

GENERAL CLASS NOTES:

Demonstrated site as of 04/04 to Clara on projector from class computer
Bookmarked working link for Clara on her tablet, from which she was able to verify accessibility
Should have a funtionally complete version next time we meet with Clara (04/18)

------------------------------------------

GRANT NOTES:

Find a way to work in a split between projected instructional spend and projected non-instructional spend
Categories for non-instructional hours: Clerical, Data entry, Case Management
For deficit/surplus report (either on main report, or subreports / new reports), show deficit/surplus BY EXPENSE CATEGORY

------------------------------------------

CLASS NOTES:

Semester not necessary -- remove it
Request to have a report that returns classes that are running within a time frame input by the end user
Would be *nice*to*have* a way to show expense associated with a class live as she enters the class input details to understand cost of proposed class
Make clear as part of documenting an app user's manual how to handle teacher changing mid-class or 2 teachers planned for 1 class (both cases treat as 2 classes)
Change language of "budgeted" to "planned"
Round hours on any reports (this goes for other categories as well)
Add a field for class location (see notes for Blackout Dates)

------------------------------------------

EMPLOYEE NOTES:

Default the "Active" check box to be checked indicating employees are active unless noted otherwise

------------------------------------------

TIMECARD NOTES:

Typically paid 2x / month (15th and last of month)
Replace "Week_Start" field with "Pay_Period_Start_Date" and "Pay_Period_End_Date"
(above Will allow for greatest flexibility, as pay periods change in duration for holidays and other off-cases)
Roles: Teacher, Data Entry, Clerical, Case Management & Other
Plans for a timecard report to reflect those active employees who did vs. did not submit a timecard in the current/last/most recent (?) pay period

------------------------------------------

NON-PAYROLL EXPENSE NOTES:

Add a "Notes" field

------------------------------------------

BLACKOUT DATES NOTES:

Make blackout dates location specific, with a dropdown including all locations (pulling from locations entered in class forms to date)
Also include an "All locations" option

------------------------------------------

*** GENERATE TEST CASES ***:

Everyone should be thinking of test cases to test functionality of parts of the app that are currently functioning
Send these test cases with expected results to Ines to carry out and provide feedback (will be an ongoing process from now until end of project)

------------------------------------------

OTHER / EXTRA:

Make everything larger
Make deficits red
Add totals beneath all datasheet-style reports
Import/export/between-year-maintenence recommmendations
Development of user's manual
Potential macro to back up and save datasheet views for an archive of what existed at specific points in time
Add data validation & comments on pages for clarity (while still maintaining a clean uncluttered page)
