Discussion days with Clara:
  March 7
  March 21
  April 4
  April 18 <- goal for finishing
  
General background:
  Ford Stevenson building - AIU 
  ESL, GED students transitioning into the workplace
  
Develop something to keep track of scheduling and grant components
  Classes are grant funded - offered at no charge to students

Run from the tablet if possible - Samsung android
  Work a lot from home - needs to be transferrable
  Clara is the only one who will be accessing it 
  
Planning for classes
  Input - total spending, broken down by class and number of weeks, must calculate teacher's salaries
  Different rates for different teachers
  Every year, state gives a different dollar amount to work with
  Variable involved for total amount, gives "you can offer x classes at this rate"

Would be nice if there was a calendar to plan out the dates, right now has to be done through excel
  Excel and access are difficult to use
  
Also include registrar, case manager, secretary, tutors, professional development positions 
  Must hours and salary also

New year start with new data, way to export or store past year's data
  Year is July-June
  March/April <- start planning for next year
  
Teacher's time sheets - categorized
  $10,000: 5000 for case management, 2000 for classes, compare teachers actual time sheets to plannd hours
  
  State - 10000         Federal - 250000
    Teacher 8000            Teacher
      Class 1                 Class 1
      Class 2                 Class 2
    CM  2000

Average 17.50 per hour, most classes with prep are 3.25 hours
  This varies but this is a general example of how it goes.
  
Do teachers always make a same amount for different classes?
  Rates can vary for each teacher

Drop down menus are better for information input
Months to compare in excel format

Clara's email:
  Clara.folino@aiu3.net

Wish list: nice to store in a dropbox
  No more putting in formulas or database type systems

Teachers paid hourly except one person
Some teachers might get paid from multiple grants
Money from different grants can be reallocated within the grant but not across grants

Most classes meet for 9.75 hours per week 
Overflow classes might be added at any time
Extra money ($60 would just extend 1 class)

Try to have a class for at least 20 weeks - 42 weeks is the year
Need ability to cancel classes and put money back in the budget

Grants: state, federal, civics, citizenship, possible future grants
  most grants have to keep track of teacher, but some include other things:
    travel
    supplies - keep track of from beginning of the year
    teachers
    case manager
    registrar
    clerical
    secretary

No minimum or maximum number of hours per week, but tries to keep it around 30
  Average comes in for the year
  
Tablet is best to use because work desktop and laptop is ridiculously guarded
  Work a lot from home on the tablet because it is less restricted

Helpful to compare year to year numbers
  Either side by side or able to save report

Know currently if you're over budget, under budget, or on track

Days of the week for classes can vary

Targeted number of students to server in the program
  Try to optimize the number of classes more often than placing specific teachers with a specific class

Email:
  blank time sheet
  database files

Teachers could be partial hours state and partial hours federal - not necessarily consistent for each week
  
Ideally, update the system every time a timesheet is turned in
  Paid twice a month - so sometimes shorter or longer pay periods
