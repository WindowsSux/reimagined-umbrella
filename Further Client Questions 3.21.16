Continuing list of questions for Clara:
  
  1. Do salaries change during the year?
  2. Can one person have multiple salaries (teachers who cover the secretary position)?
  3. Are meetings for each class always the same length or do you need to be able to edit each individual meeting?
  4. Are meetings sometimes cancelled and do you therefore need to be able to edit the number of meetings held for each class?
