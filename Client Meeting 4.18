Budget by Grant:
  - have breakdown per line item
    - instructional, non-instructional, other (travel, supplies)
    - add another report tab next to budget by grant for line item break down

Employees page:
  - test for volunteers
    - add validation to default all rates to 0
    
    
Timesheets:
  - change button names in reports
  - add dropdown for employee and class name on employee report
  - add in non-instructional breakdown on employee report
  
Non-Payroll Expenses:
  - expense category drop down menu - remove instructional and non-intructional
  
Plan Other:
  - should we change the sorting to employee category rather than sorting by grant
  
Plan Classes:
  - remove all locations from class location drop down menu
  - make sure schedules are measured in 15 minute blocks
  - round planned instruction to nearest hundreth
  - class schedule check
    - change 'class conflict view' heading after 'return overlapping classes' button is clicked
  - add total to class overview sheet

Blackout Dates:
  - require only location or class but not both
  - can we just add the location to the plan other page for the employee and if that's the case, will it be part of the blackout data?
  
Locations: 

Arrange side bar to reflect ideal order 
  - (Grant - Employee - Class Location - Plan Classes - Blackout Dates - Plan Other - Non-Payroll Expenses - Timesheets)
  
More information on page (rather than user guides) is better
HOW DOES SHE SAVE EVERYTHING?  DOES SHE HAVE TO DO IT FOR EVERY PAGE INDIVIDUALLY?
Is there a way to show the average employee instructional rate on the employee report page?
