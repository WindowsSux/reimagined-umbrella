________________________________________________________________________________
3. Every time you finish changes to the app, upload it to github.
    when you upload a function, make sure it still works
4. Set up a testing mechanic
    Ant for java - for every function, it creates and exercises test cases
    what is the equivalent for webapp?
        set up the skeleton of a test suite so we can confirm that these functions exist and do that they need to do
          add new class -> (make it a really stupid name), confirm new class exists, delete class, confirm that class is gone
        every time we change for a bug, update the test cases to cover everything
        DON'T BREAK THE BUILD
          if tests 1-17 passed last night, they should pass tonight.
5. Get a functioning system as quickly as possible.
    number of modules should exceed number of teams
        define appropriate interfaces so data can flow smoothly

Groups:
    1. Grant info, class info, calendar/holidays
        
    2. expense, employee info, timecard
        
    3. reports, testing, dummy data
    
   
    FAQ/UserGuide/ImportantInfo/Troubleshooting
